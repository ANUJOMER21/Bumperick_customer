/**
 * Animation Guide for Bumperick App
 * 
 * This file provides comprehensive guidance on how to use animations effectively
 * throughout the app while maintaining performance and user experience.

/**
 * Animation Usage Guidelines:
 * 
 * 1. SCREEN TRANSITIONS:
 *    - Use slideInFromRight() + slideOutToLeft() for forward navigation
 *    - Use slideInFromLeft() + slideOutToRight() for back navigation
 *    - Use slideInFromBottom() + slideOutToBottom() for modal presentations
 *    - Use fadeInTransition() + fadeOutTransition() for subtle transitions
 *    - Use scaleInTransition() + scaleOutTransition() for attention-grabbing elements
 * 
 * 2. BUTTON ANIMATIONS:
 *    - Use animateScale() for press feedback (scale: 0.95f)
 *    - Use animateElevation() for hover effects
 *    - Use animateRotation() for loading states
 *    - Use animateBounce() for success states
 * 
 * 3. CARD ANIMATIONS:
 *    - Use animateScale() for press feedback
 *    - Use animateElevation() for hover effects
 *    - Use animateStaggered() for list items
 *    - Use animateFadeTransition() for visibility changes
 * 
 * 4. LIST ANIMATIONS:
 *    - Use animateStaggered() for staggered entrance
 *    - Use animateFadeTransition() for item visibility
 *    - Use animateSlide() for item removal
 *    - Use animateScale() for item selection
 * 
 * 5. LOADING ANIMATIONS:
 *    - Use animateShimmer() for skeleton loading
 *    - Use animatePulse() for attention-grabbing elements
 *    - Use animateRotation() for spinners
 *    - Use animateBounce() for success states
 * 
 * 6. MICRO-ANIMATIONS:
 *    - Use animateScale() for icon interactions
 *    - Use animateRotation() for icon state changes
 *    - Use animateFadeTransition() for content changes
 *    - Use animateSlide() for content transitions
 * 
 * 7. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 *    - Use optimized animation modifiers for better performance
 *    - Avoid animating too many properties simultaneously
 *    - Use appropriate animation specs (tween vs spring)
 *    - Consider using remember for expensive calculations
 *    - Use LaunchedEffect for one-time animations
 *    - Avoid nested animations
 *    - Use graphicsLayer for hardware acceleration
 *    - Consider using LazyColumn/LazyRow for large lists
 *    - Use appropriate animation durations
 *    - Test on lower-end devices
 * 
 * 8. ANIMATION DURATIONS:
 *    - Fast animations: 150ms (button presses, micro-interactions)
 *    - Normal animations: 300ms (screen transitions, card interactions)
 *    - Slow animations: 500ms (complex transitions, loading states)
 *    - Extra slow animations: 800ms (splash screens, major transitions)
 * 
 * 9. EASING CURVES:
 *    - EASE_IN_OUT: Natural, smooth transitions
 *    - EASE_OUT: Quick start, smooth end
 *    - EASE_IN: Smooth start, quick end
 *    - SHARP_EASE_OUT: Quick start, sharp end
 *    - SPRING: Natural, bouncy feel
 * 
 * 10. ANIMATION TYPES BY USE CASE:
 *    - SCREEN_TRANSITION: Navigation between screens
 *    - BUTTON_PRESS: Button interactions
 *    - CARD_HOVER: Card hover effects
 *    - LIST_ITEM: List item animations
 *    - FAB: Floating action button
 *    - DIALOG: Dialog presentations
 *    - BOTTOM_SHEET: Bottom sheet presentations
 *    - SEARCH_BAR: Search bar interactions
 *    - LOADING: Loading states
 *    - SUCCESS: Success feedback
 *    - ERROR: Error feedback
 * 
 * 11. ANIMATION DIRECTIONS:
 *    - LEFT_TO_RIGHT: Forward navigation
 *    - RIGHT_TO_LEFT: Back navigation
 *    - TOP_TO_BOTTOM: Modal presentation
 *    - BOTTOM_TO_TOP: Modal dismissal
 *    - FADE: Subtle transitions
 *    - SCALE: Attention-grabbing elements
 *    - SLIDE_UP: Content appearance
 *    - SLIDE_DOWN: Content disappearance
 * 
 * 12. BEST PRACTICES:
 *    - Keep animations subtle and purposeful
 *    - Use consistent timing and easing
 *    - Test on various devices and screen sizes
 *    - Consider user preferences (reduce motion)
 *    - Use animations to guide user attention
 *    - Avoid over-animating
 *    - Use animations to provide feedback
 *    - Consider accessibility
 *    - Test performance impact
 *    - Use appropriate animation types
 * 
 * 13. COMMON PATTERNS:
 *    - Button press: animateScale(isPressed = true)
 *    - Card hover: animateElevation(isHovered = true)
 *    - List item: animateStaggered(index = index, isVisible = true)
 *    - Screen transition: slideInFromRight() + slideOutToLeft()
 *    - Loading state: animateShimmer(isShimmering = true)
 *    - Success state: animateBounce(isBouncing = true)
 *    - Error state: animateTranslation(offsetX = 10f)
 *    - Icon rotation: animateRotation(targetRotation = 360f)
 *    - Content fade: animateFadeTransition(isVisible = true)
 *    - Content slide: animateSlide(direction = AnimationDirection.LEFT_TO_RIGHT)
 * 
 * 14. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
 *    - Use optimized animation modifiers
 *    - Avoid animating too many properties
 *    - Use appropriate animation specs
 *    - Consider using remember for expensive calculations
 *    - Use LaunchedEffect for one-time animations
 *    - Avoid nested animations
 *    - Use graphicsLayer for hardware acceleration
 *    - Consider using LazyColumn/LazyRow for large lists
 *    - Use appropriate animation durations
 *    - Test on lower-end devices
 * 
 * 15. TESTING:
 *    - Test on various devices
 *    - Test with different screen sizes
 *    - Test with different orientations
 *    - Test with different performance levels
 *    - Test with accessibility features
 *    - Test with reduced motion preferences
 *    - Test with different animation speeds
 *    - Test with different animation types
 *    - Test with different animation directions
 *    - Test with different animation durations
